We identified what users care about the most when writing restaurant reviews, and ultimately determine what certain restaurants are doing right and wrong in order to receive these ratings.

In order to do that, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) algorithm to find out the most relevant 50 topics.
We used the Yelp Academic Dataset to get the reviews. 

After training, we tested our system against new examples of reviews to generate the topics in those new reviews. We also performed sentiment analysis on the reviews.

This enabled us to not only generate the topic of the review but also whether it was talked about in a negative way or a positive way.
